   = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
             <Vec<T, A> as From<Box<[T], A>>>
             <Vec<T, A> as From<VecDeque<T, A>>>
             <Vec<T> as From<&[T]>>
             <Vec<T> as From<&mut [T]>>
             <Vec<T> as From<BinaryHeap<T>>>
             <Vec<T> as From<Cow<'a, [T]>>>
             <Vec<T> as From<[T; N]>>
             <Vec<u8> as From<&str>>
           and 2 others
   = note: this error originates in the macro `query` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
